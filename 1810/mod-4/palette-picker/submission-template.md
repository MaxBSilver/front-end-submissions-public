 # Code Quality

 #### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub (from either repository) that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/MaxBSilver/hexbrush-fe/blob/master/src/components/ColorGenerator/ColorGenerator.jsx)

 * Why were you proud of this piece of code?  
- Lines 26-35: generateHex does exactly what is is supposed to do, it generates HexCodes. It doesn't change colors if they are locked. This function was really convoluted but we were able to refactor it. 

 #### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/MaxBSilver/hexbrush-fe/blob/master/src/components/ColorGenerator/ColorGenerator.jsx)

 * Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
- Lines ALL: We feel there must be a better way to handle a lot of what we were doing in ColorGenerator. Our front-end design scheme involves passing props up and down far too much.

 #### Link to Design Inspiration

 * Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it  
[design inspiration](https://www.color-hex.com/random.php)    
- We liked how simplistic this site is, the project is constantly flashing colors so we went with a very basic design in an attempt to reduce user confusion.

 #### Reflection on New Concepts

 * Describe your thoughts on server-side testing  
- Seems much more straightforward than FE testing.
* Describe your thoughts on TravisCI  
- TravisCI seems amazing for maintaining code integrity. However we weren't able to get it up and working for this project.
* Describe your thoughts in creating a single project whose codebase was distributed across multiple repositories
- We believe separate directories in one repository would make it easier.
